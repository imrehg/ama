# imrehg/ama

A repository to ask [@imrehg](https://twitter.com/imrehg) anything.

I lived and worked in Hungary, the UK, and in Taiwan for many years. Did research
in academia, started a [hackerspace](https://taipeihack.org), run events (such as
Ignite Taipei, Future Shorts Taipei, Geek Dinner Taipei... yeah, I'm home there:),
did many open source electronics hardware and open source software projects, advised
people on the same, [written](https://gergely.imreh.net/blog), and generally focused
on building communities and helping people build awesome stuff.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/imrehg/ama/issues/new) on this project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry - if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/imrehg/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@imrehg](https://twitter.com/imrehg) on
Twitter.
